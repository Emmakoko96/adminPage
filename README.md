# AdminPage
## Built using AngularJS.
An AdminPage template that can be incorporated into any website for the monitoring and management of a website.


## Installation
1. Clone it!
2. Set up your local server so routing can work fine.
3. Enjoy


## Usage
This template uses AngularJS for all work-flow and ui-router specifically for routing.
It has few tabs presently namely:
1. Dashboard
2. Users
3. MailBox
4. Tasks

with all working fine with their routing.


However you need to be logged-in to view all these (of course as an Admin!).

Login Credentials are:

### *Username- admin
